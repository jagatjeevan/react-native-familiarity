# Getting familiar with react native.

This project is created using "Expo". Installation process: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

# Installation

If you are using a phone to test, Install expo by going to "play store" in android and "App store" in iOs.
If you are using a simulator to test, follow the above link for simulator setup (android studio for android and Simulator for iOs platform)

`npx expo install` would install all the dependencies.
`npm start` this would start the application. You would see a QR Code.
If you are using phone, open expo app and then scan the qr code.
If you are using simulators, then type 'i' for iOs and 'a' for android to run the application. Make sure the simulators are open.
